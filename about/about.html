        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>
            As a junior developer, I am currently honing my skills in computer systems engineering,
            with a primary focus on Front-End development. While I have gained proficiency in
            technologies such as Java, I am eager to broaden my expertise and delve into the
            Back-End realm.
            <br>
            <br>
            My knowledge extends to Back-End technologies like MY-SQL, PL-SQL, and data
            structures, and I am excited about the prospect of gaining more hands-on experience
            in this area. Strengthening my Back-End skills will not only complement my existing
            Front-End capabilities but also allow me to contribute more effectively to
            comprehensive and well-integrated software solutions.

                    I specialized in Odoo application development during my working period, focusing on
                    front-end responsibilities. I successfully crafted and customized websites, demonstrating
                    proficiency in building Odoo apps, models, themes, menus, and submenus.
                    Additionally, I adeptly modified existing Odoo code to align with specific customer
                    needs. This experience has enhanced my skills in Full Stack Development, emphasizing
                    my ability to create tailored solutions for clients.

                    Throughout my training, I acquired extensive experience in frontend languages such as
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SASS, as well as Unit Testing and React. I completed
                    various tasks in each language to improve my skills, but the two most significant tasks
                    were the creation of a React admin page and a weather website.
