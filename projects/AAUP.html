            <strong>
                Firstly, we would like to express our deepest gratitude and thank Almighty Allah who gave us the
                abilities and power to complete this project, and then we would like to thank from the deepest our
                supervisor, Dr. Mahmoud Obaid who has been very supportive and been with us all the time to make this
                project as good as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, we wish to thank our families, friends, and the Faculty of Engineering and Information
                Technology for providing us with facilities as well as their support and advice.

            This project aims to develop an AI chat robot using Chatterbot technology, speech recognition libraries in
            Python, and Google's APIs to assist students in the College of Engineering and Information Technology. The
            robot has a sensor system that detects when a student has a question, and they can ask their question
            through the robot's microphone. The spoken question is then converted into text using Google's
            Speech-to-Text API. The AI module, built using Chatterbot, analyses the question and retrieves the answer
            from its database. The response is converted back to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API and
            output through the robot's speaker. The robot provides specialized information on computer systems
            engineering to help students find answers to their queries. The project involves building the AI module,
            implementing speech recognition, integrating Google's API, designing and building the sensor system, and
            developing the robot. Testing and refinement of the system are necessary to ensure its functionality and
            performance. The project will benefit the college's students and visitors by providing them with an
            accessible and reliable source of information.

            Sophia, the first citizen robot of the world!.
            <br>
            A humanoid robot that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn and gain experience by interacting with
            humans, Sophia, can hear questions and answer them in real time. Sophia has the human form in terms of
            artificial skin, face, and eyes, and she has been given some human gestures such as looking at a speaker's
            face. As a result, she obtained Saudi citizenship and took this position as the world's first robot in this
            position. Developed in Hong Kong by Hanson Robotics of America company in 2015. Sophia has so far been built
            on the waist only. They have eye-shaped cameras that can recognize faces they've seen before, so they can
            say hello to anyone by name. Because her skin is made of flexible silicone, she can perform 62 facial
            expressions. She uses a voice technology system that allows her to speak and gesture while she delivers her
            message. (Retto, 2017)

            designed to learn, adapt, and interact naturally with people.”
